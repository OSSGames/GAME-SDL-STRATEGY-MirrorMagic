GNU GPL V2

COMPILE INSTRUCTIONS
--------------------
This version was modified to compile on ArcaOS with GCC 9 compiler. It also uses the Watcom Linker and Watcom Resource Compiler. 

The requeriments for compile this version are:
- yum install git gcc make libc-devel binutils watcom-wrc watcom-wlink-hll
- yum install SDL2-devel SDL2_image-devel SDL2_mixer-devel SDL2_net-devel SDL2_ttf-devel perl zlib-devel pthread-devel libcx-devel

1) Remember to have correct header files your path. For GCC the correct ones are the included on the "libc-devel", not the ones from the OS/2 Toolkit. Check your config.sys for "SET INCLUDE=C:\usr\include"

2) Since I'm using the Watcom Resource Compiler and Watcom Linker (open source) instead of the classic rc.exe and ilink.exe, add to your config.sys...
 SET EMXOMFLD_RC_TYPE=WRC
 SET EMXOMFLD_RC=wrc.exe
 SET EMXOMFLD_LINKER=wl.exe
 SET EMXOMFLD_TYPE=WLINK

3) Run "make" to compile or "make 2>&1 |tee make.out" to compile and get the log file. A compile.cmd file was provided to run the compile process.
